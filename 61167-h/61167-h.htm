<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">Your guide for the project</span></h2>
<h3>What you will learn</h3>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. The names and use of common sewing tools.</dt>
<dt>2. To organize a sewing box.</dt>
<dt>3. To develop good sewing habits.</dt>
<dt>4. To combine pretty colors.</dt>
<dt>5. To use the sewing machine.</dt></dl>
<h3>What articles you will make</h3>
<p>As a club member, you will be required to
complete two articles.</p>
<p>First you will make <i>one</i> practice article:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dd>A case for your sewing shears.</dd></dl>
<p>Then you will make <i>one</i> main project
article:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dd>A barbecue placemat or a traveling kit.</dd></dl>
<h3>Start your record book</h3>
<p>Attend all your meetings so that you will
be able to complete your project as soon as
possible. When your home agent gives you a
4-H record book and record sheets, she wants
you to record the work you do on your project.
Give her this information in writing.
Tell her how much you enjoyed making the
articles and how much you and your family
enjoyed using them.</p>
<h3>Learn to give a demonstration</h3>
<p>Show others what &ldquo;tricks&rdquo; you have
learned by giving a demonstration at one of
your club meetings, or ask your mother to
invite your family friends to your home. It
will be fun to use the placemats or show
them your other projects. They will be interested
in how they were made. Tell them
what you did and what you learned about
using your mother&rsquo;s sewing machine and the
sewing tools.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">Plan your project</span></h2>
<p>Your projects will be more interesting if
you plan them with your mother and leader,
because they can help you to understand and
enjoy your new adventures in sewing. Take
your mother with you to your first meeting
to introduce her to your leader and your
friends. This will also give her an opportunity
to see the kind of projects you will be
working on during this year.</p>
<p>You will need your mother&rsquo;s cooperation
and advice in selecting both equipment and
fabrics for the projects. She may be able to
loan you some of her sewing tools too. Sharing
with your mother as you work will help
you learn to know each other better.</p>
<p>Before shopping for your supplies, read
your bulletin to see what supplies are needed.
Plan ahead so you can do all your shopping
for your articles at one time.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for the colors of the
fabrics used in these projects to match or
even blend, because they are not going to be
used together. But&mdash;since the articles may be
exhibited together, they will look nicer if
the colors look pretty when placed next to
each other.</p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="ssn">Pair of Scissors</span></p>
</div>
<p>If your mother has several types of cutting
tools in her sewing box, you have already
learned that shears and scissors will
cut both fabric and thread, but one is easier
to use for cutting thread than the other.</p>
<p>Little scissors like the small pair illustrated
are meant to clip thread or cut narrow
things like ribbon, elastic, etc. Scissors have
very sharp and narrow points to make it possible
to clip into tiny corners. Scissors have
two handles the same size.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p01k.jpg" alt="{holding scissors}" width="440" height="212" />
</div>
<p>When you cut with scissors, put your
thumb through one handle and a finger
through the other. A pair of small scissors
about 4 inches in length is easy to handle.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p01m.jpg" alt="{holding shears}" width="442" height="202" />
</div>
<p>Shears are larger than scissors, and they
are used for cutting a pattern out of material.
Shears have one large handle and one small
one. When you cut with shears, place your
thumb through the small handle and two or
three fingers through the larger handle. A
pair of 7-inch shears is a good size for you.</p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="ssn">Needles and Pins and Pincushion and Thimble</span></p>
</div>
<h4>Needles</h4>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p01p.jpg" alt="{packet of needles}" width="414" height="378" />
</div>
<p>When you buy needles, search for slender
ones with long eyes. If they are slender, they
will slip in and out of the material without
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
much effort. The long eye will be easier for
you to thread. Also notice the length of the
needles. Will they be easy for you to handle?</p>
<h4>Pins</h4>
<p>Pins are used to hold the pattern and material
together while you cut out a pattern, or
to help you hold the pieces of material together
when you are getting ready to sew.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" alt="{Fabric, Pattern}" width="452" height="470" />
</div>
<p>If you borrow some pins from your
mother, you will be a smart little girl if you
notice whether they <i>slip</i> into your material
easily. Avoid using pins that are too large or
have a blunt point. They are likely to snag
or tear the material.</p>
<p>If you buy new pins, ask the saleslady for
<i>brass pins</i>. These are strong pins, but fine in
size.</p>
<h4>Pincushion</h4>
<p>To help you develop the habit of putting
pins and needles into a pincushion, always
remember to wear your pincushion when you
sew. If you drop pins or needles they are
hard to find because they are small and will
easily slip into a hiding place, where they
may hurt someone later.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02e.jpg" alt="{wrist pincushion}" width="339" height="181" />
</div>
<p>The wrist pincushion is the most convenient.
If you are right-handed, wear the pincushion
near your wrist on your left arm. If
you are left-handed, wear the pincushion
near your wrist on your right arm.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02f.jpg" alt="NEVER hold PINS in your mouth!" width="426" height="376" />
</div>
<h4>Thimble</h4>
<p>People who sew usually wear thimbles for
several reasons. They help to push the needle
through the material, and they protect the
finger from being pricked by the needle.</p>
<p>To push the needle through the material
with the end of the thimble, hold the needle
between the thumb and the first finger so that
the eye end of the needle is resting against
the end of the thimble.</p>

</div>
<p>When you begin to use the sewing machine,
you will be snipping many threads.
Keep the area around your sewing table neat
by using a paper bag for a wastebasket for
scraps of material, paper, and thread. Fasten
it to the edge of the table where you can
reach it easily when you are sitting at the
machine.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02k.jpg" alt="{Wastebasket on table}" width="416" height="212" />
</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">Organize a box or basket for tools and supplies</span></h2>
<p>All of your sewing tools are like a happy
family&mdash;each has a job to do to help you sew.
You will therefore, find it helpful to know
where your tools are and to keep them in
place when you are not using them, instead
of leaving your thimble on the arm of a chair,
the shears hidden under a newspaper, or a
bobbin in your pocket.</p>
<p>A box is easy to organize into an equipment
box and convenient to store in your
dresser drawer, on your closet shelf, or in a
bigger box which will hold your projects.</p>
<p>You should look for two kinds of boxes&mdash;one
large box and many small ones. The large
box should be sturdy, clean, and long enough
to hold your longest tool. The pincushion
may become the tallest tool when it is covered
with pins and needles.</p>
<p>The small boxes may vary in size. Tiny
boxes like those used for earrings are good
for small items like the thimble, bobbins, etc.
Bigger boxes are needed for the pincushion,
thread, and other items.</p>
<p>When you have all of your boxes collected
you will be ready to start your project.</p>
<p>Separate the box tops from the boxes.
Then arrange the smaller boxes so they fit
into the larger box. Be sure to save enough
space for the 12-inch ruler or the length of
your shears. Then have mother help you
staple or paste the sides of the open boxes
together and fasten them into the large box.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02m.jpg" alt="Staples" width="299" height="295" />
</div>
<p>To make this box even more useful, you
could label each little partition with the
names of the tools or supplies you plan to
store in each, as shown in the picture of a
well organized box on <a href="#Page_6">page 6</a>.</p>
<p>If you would rather have a container
which could be easily carried from room to
room, you might like to buy a fishing tackle
box like your brother uses for his supplies.
Choosing one with dividers in it will help
you to organize your sewing tools very
nicely.</p>
<p>Some girls use little doll suitcases, or a
small cosmetic case like grown-ups use when
traveling. Either of these are very nice, because
they are usually pretty in color, and
will open up wide so you can see all your
sewing tools at one time. They also have a
latch to fasten the cover and a handle which
makes them easy to carry.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="c10">How to use the sewing machine</h3>
<h4>Is your chair the right height?</h4>
<dl class="undent"><dd>&#149; Can you see the needle easily as it moves up and down?</dd>
<dd>&#149; Are you able to reach behind the needle?</dd>
<dd>&#149; Can you rest your arms on the table?</dd>
<dd>&#149; Do your feet touch the floor?</dd></dl>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04n.jpg" alt="Using a sewing machine" width="548" height="500" />
</div>
<p>If you cannot see the needle or rest your
arms on the table, you will need a taller chair
or something to sit on to raise you up a bit.
If your feet do not touch the floor (after you
are sitting in the position to see the needle)
and your machine has a foot control you will
have to find a sturdy box. It should be large
enough to rest both of your feet, as well as
the foot control from the machine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h4>How to start and stop the machine</h4>
<p>With your machine unthreaded and the
presser foot raised, it is ready for you to
start. Place your right hand on the balance
wheel. (It will help you to start the machine
in motion.)</p>
<p>Keep your left hand a distance from the
needle to avoid this&mdash;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="WARNING" width="460" height="284" />
</div>
<h4>How to speed up and slow down</h4>
<p>Place your foot or knee on the control or
treadle.</p>
<p>See how slowly you can make the needle
go up and down. If the machine runs too fast
for you, you can press your right hand
against the balance wheel to slow it down.</p>
<p>Practice until your foot or knee can control
the speed evenly from fast to slow, without
using your right hand on the balance
wheel.</p>
<h4>How to stitch correctly</h4>
<p>Slip a piece of material under the presser
foot. (Your leader will have a piece for you.)
Lower the needle into the material by rolling
your right hand on the balance wheel until
the needle goes down as far as possible. Then
lower the presser foot onto the material.</p>
<p>Let the machine run without your hands
touching the material. You will notice that it
will slip and slide in many directions. To
guide the material, hold your left hand on it
with your fingers curved as if you were holding
a ball in your hand. If you hold it gently,
you can guide the material as it slips under
your fingers without interrupting its movement
as it is being sewn. Try it!</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05a.jpg" alt="{Guiding the material}" width="514" height="396" />
</div>
<p>Your right hand will also help you to
guide the material. As soon as the machine is
in motion, take your right hand off the balance
wheel. You will soon discover that you
will have to practice the trick of sewing
straight.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05e.jpg" alt="Do not run off the EDGE of material." width="520" height="187" />
</div>
<p>Slow down your speed when you near the
end of your material so that you can stop
when you reach the edge. Roll the balance
wheel to raise the needle&mdash;then lift the
presser foot to remove the material.</p>
<h4>How to use the stitch regulator</h4>
<p>If your sewing machine has a lever which
makes it sew backward, try to use it now.
Move the stitch regulator up as far as it will
go. As you start the machine you will see it
moving backward. In order to stitch forward
again, push the lever back down as far as it
will go. As you will learn in your projects,
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
you will always have to sew very slowly and
carefully when you sew backward in order to
do it nicely.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05f.jpg" alt="{stitch regulator}" width="80" height="247" />
</div>
<p>Another reason the stitch regulator is on
your machine is to make the stitches larger
or smaller for you, whichever is best for the
material with which you are working.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05g.jpg" alt="8 STITCHES" width="466" height="174" />
</div>
<p>Some machines have numbers next to the
lever to tell you the number of stitches per
inch. If your machine does not have such
numbers, you will be able to tell the number
of stitches per inch by putting a line of
stitching into a piece of material, and counting
the number of stitches sewn in a one-inch
space.</p>
<h4>How to practice stitching</h4>
<p>Mark some straight and curved lines on
your piece of material. (Paper may also be
used but it dulls the needle; material is best.)</p>
<p>Roll the balance wheel to lower the needle
at the end of one of the lines. Lower the
presser foot and start the machine. Slowly
stitch the entire line (without thread), guiding
your material so the needle follows the
line as much as possible. Practice stitching
along a marked line without thread, going
backward and forward with both small and
large stitches.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05h.jpg" alt="{Practice stitching}" width="470" height="440" />
</div>
<p>When you can control the speed of the
machine and stitch straight, you have learned
some important secrets of mother&rsquo;s sewing.
Soon you will be ready to start on your first
project.</p>
<h4>How to thread the machine</h4>
<p>Would you like to be able to thread the
machine as easily as your leader threads it?
Ask her to do it very slowly for you so you
can learn it from her. Watch closely as she
hooks the thread onto every finger of each
thread guide until she finally reaches the
needle. She will also show you where the
bobbin hides (remember this is the flat spool
in the lower part of the machine) and how
you will get its thread to the top of the machine.</p>
<p>After you have threaded the machine be
sure to have your leader check it before you
try to sew. If you want the machine to &ldquo;work
like magic&rdquo; you will have to have it threaded
correctly.</p>
<h4>Stitching with a threaded machine</h4>
<p>You have probably learned how to follow
a marked line very well by this time. It is
also important to see that you will be able to
do as well when you actually stitch with
thread.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="c13">A shears case</h3>
<p>The first article you will make is a shears
case. It can be used to store your shears in
your sewing box. This will help remind you
that these are special shears and should be
used only for cutting fabric. Cutting paper
will make them dull.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig23">

<p class="pcap"><span class="ssn">The first article you will make is a &ldquo;Shears Case&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<p>A shears case will protect the sharp points
from being damaged by hitting other tools
in the box. It will also protect your fingers
when you reach for your shears or for your
other sewing tools.</p>
<h4>What you will learn</h4>
<dl class="undent"><dd>&#149; To recognize the feel and appearance of felt or nonwoven interfacing.</dd>
<dd>&#149; To choose and buy pretty material and thread.</dd>
<dd>&#149; To read ruler measurements.</dd>
<dd>&#149; To make a pattern according to measurements.</dd>
<dd>&#149; To pin a pattern to the material.</dd>
<dd>&#149; To handle the shears when cutting material.</dd>
<dd>&#149; To use tailor&rsquo;s chalk or a tailor&rsquo;s pencil for marking around the pattern.</dd>
<dd>&#149; To use the stitch regulator for backstitching and adjusting the size of stitches.</dd>
<dd>&#149; To use the toe of the presser foot as a marked line for stitching straight.</dd>
<dd>&#149; To make a hem and stitch it.</dd></dl>
<h4>What you will do first</h4>
<p>To make a shears case you will need to
buy felt or nonwoven interfacing (suit-weight),
thread, and tailor&rsquo;s chalk or pencil.</p>
<p>If your shears are 8 inches or less in
length, the felt swatches (9 inches wide and
12 inches long) sold in many stores are a
good buy. If your shears are over 8 inches
long see <a href="#Page_14">page 14</a> for directions. Ask your
leader or your mother to help you decide how
much fabric you will need.</p>
<p>If it is easy for you to stitch straight, try
a color of thread which is different from your
material to add color to your case.</p>
<p>If you are still having difficulty stitching
on a straight line, it would be better to use
thread which matches your material because
mistakes will be less easy to see. You can use
either regular or heavy duty thread.</p>
<p>Tools and supplies you will need to make
the case are as follows.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Pencil</p>
<p class="t0">12-inch ruler</p>
<p class="t0">Paper shears</p>
<p class="t0">Fabric</p>
<p class="t0">Paper</p>
<p class="t0">Thread</p>
<p class="t0">Bobbin</p>
<p class="t0">Tailor&rsquo;s chalk or tailor&rsquo;s pencil</p>
<p class="t0">Shears</p>
</div>
<h3>How to make the shears case</h3>
<h4>Make a paper pattern</h4>
<p>Measure the length of your shears on a
piece of paper. Mark this length with lines
AB and CD. Then draw a vertical line between
these two lines by placing a ruler on
the lines as shown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="{measuring the shears}" width="474" height="320" />
</div>
<p>Measure the width of the shears by placing
them on the vertical line so that the intersection
of the handles and the points of
the shears rest on the line.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07b.jpg" alt="{making a pattern}" width="344" height="316" />
</div>
<p>Measure across the widest part of the
handles. (Ask your leader to help you read
the ruler.) Label points E and G. Also measure
the width &frac12; inch from the point of the
shears. Label these two points as F and H.</p>
<p>Make a pattern for the pocket by drawing
lines with your ruler, from point E to F and
G to H. Extend these lines to the full length
of the shears.</p>
<h4>Mark the fabric; follow the illustration</h4>
<p>Use your ruler to measure and mark your
fabric. It is most important that you are careful
to measure accurately and mark very
straight lines. Use tailor&rsquo;s chalk or tailor&rsquo;s
pencil for marking. Then ask your leader to
check your material and your markings. They
must be perfectly marked to prevent trouble
when you sew the case together later.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07c.jpg" alt="Shears&rsquo; Length + 1 inch" width="446" height="368" />
</div>
<h4>Cut the fabric</h4>
<p>Since cutting material, especially heavy
material like felt or nonwoven interfacing, is
different than cutting paper, practice on
some scraps of material before you cut the
fabric for the case. You will have the best cut
edge if you open the shears wide and take
long even strokes in cutting. Do not close the
points of the shears until you reach the end
of the pattern or the material. Cut the piece
of fabric along the marked lines.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig24">
<img src="images/p07d.jpg" alt="" width="474" height="462" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="ssn">ALWAYS HOLD AND CUT MATERIAL ON THE TABLE</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<h4>Mark the hem on section A</h4>
<p>A hem (material folded back on itself) is
needed on the top edge of Section A to make
the top strong enough so it will not tear
when the shears are slipped into the pocket.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07e.jpg" alt="Section A, &frac12; inch" width="360" height="348" />
</div>
<p>Measure &frac12; inch from the top edge of section
A. Mark with pins. Then fold the edge
down so the pins lie on the outside of the
fold. Press a fold along the pins. Ask your
leader to show you how to press with a steam
iron or a pressing cloth.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07f.jpg" alt="Press QUICKLY: Material SCORCHES Easily!" width="464" height="230" />
</div>
<p>You have learned to stitch straight by following
a line. When you stitch this hem your
presser foot <i>not the needle</i> will follow a line.
Place your material under the presser foot
with the cut edge touching the inside edge of
the toe of the presser foot. Your leader will
show you how this is done.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07g.jpg" alt="{Sewing hem}" width="491" height="316" />
</div>
<dl class="undent pcap"><dt>Fold</dt>
<dt>Use 8 Stitches per inch</dt>
<dt><i>Outside</i> edge of toe runs along cut edge</dt></dl>
<p>You may want to practice before stitching
the hem into this part of your shears case.
Look back to <a href="#Page_10">page 10</a> if you have forgotten
how to start and end a line of stitching.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07h.jpg" alt="Cut the flap as illustrated" width="437" height="393" />
</div>
<h4>Shape the flap of section B</h4>
<p>In order to neatly fold the top of section
B over the shears, and also to make the shears
case more interesting, cut the flap as shown
above.</p>
<p>Measure &frac12; inch from the sides of fabric
piece B&mdash;points a and b. Then measure 2
inches from the top of section B&mdash;points c
and d.</p>
<p>Using a ruler, draw a straight line between
points a and c and points b and d. Cut along
a-c and b-d with long, even strokes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<h4>Mark the pocket on section A</h4>
<p>Fold section A in half. Carefully put pins
into the fold to mark the center. Fold the
pocket pattern, which you cut earlier, in half.
Place the center crease of the pocket pattern
on the pins marking the center of section A.</p>
<p>The top edge of the pattern should be
even with hemline (folded edge) of section A.</p>
<p>Open the pocket pattern and pin it in
place. Measure the distance between the
paper pattern and the outer edge of section
A at the top and bottom of the pattern.</p>
<p>Trace around the pattern with tailor&rsquo;s
chalk or your tailor&rsquo;s pencil. Keep the chalk
line very sharp, because you will be using
it as a guide for stitching the pocket.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="{Pattern}" width="470" height="300" />
</div>
<h4>Get the pocket ready to stitch</h4>
<p>To make the pocket, you will be stitching
section A and section B together. Since two
thicknesses of fabric are more bulky than a
single thickness, it will be necessary to learn
how to pin them together so they will not
slip when you are stitching them.</p>
<p>Place section A over section B with cut
edges of lower corners and side edges matching.
The hem should be folded to the inside
and chalk markings to the outside.</p>
<p class="tb">Pin the two pieces together with the
points of the pins directed to the side edges
of the case.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08d.jpg" alt="KEEP FABRIC SMOOTH IN PINNING" width="480" height="412" />
</div>
<h4>Machine stitch the pocket</h4>
<p>Adjust the stitch regulator to 8 stitches
per inch. Lower the needle on the stitched
hemline of section A. Lower the presser foot
after the threads have been drawn between
the toes to the back of the machine.</p>
<p>Backstitch until the needle pierces folded
edge, or knot the thread according to directions
on <a href="#Page_21">page 21</a>. Then adjust the stitch regulator
to forward motion.</p>
<p>Stitch following the line you have marked,
stitching on it as much as possible. Apply
little pressure onto the knee lever or foot
pedal so the machine will not move too fast.</p>
<p>When you reach the point of the pocket,
lower the needle into the point of material,
raise the presser foot, turn the material
around, lower the presser foot again, and
stitch to the next point. The presser foot
needs to be raised and lowered in this manner
each time you want to turn a corner.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08e.jpg" alt="{Presser foot}" width="230" height="353" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Stitch to the fold of the hem. When you
reach the fold, backstitch to the stitching
line of the hem.</p>
<p>With your small scissors clip the threads
close to the stitching line.</p>
<h4>Sew sections A and B together</h4>
<p>The side seams of the case must still be
stitched together. This is done on the outside
of the case.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08f.jpg" alt="{Case with side seams}" width="204" height="342" />
</div>
<p>Place your shears case under the presser
foot so that the cut edges are even with the
outside of the narrow toe. Start stitching in
the hem of section A.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08g.jpg" alt="Watch your presser foot when you sew!" width="418" height="430" />
</div>
<p>When you reach each corner remember to
turn your wheel by <i>hand</i> so the needle goes
into the material at the exact turning point.
Turn corner as you learned on <a href="#Page_16">page 16</a>. Do
not try to use the electricity when reaching
or turning corners until you know how to
use the machine as easily and as accurately as
your mother or leader.</p>
<p class="tb">After you have stitched around the entire
case, sew over the first stitches you made in
the hem.</p>
<p>Clip the threads short. (Are you remembering
to put the clipped threads into the
paper bag fastened to your machine?)</p>
<h4>Change the top of section B into a flap</h4>
<p>In order to keep the upper part of section
B in a folded position so it will keep the
shears in the pocket, you need to add one
more row of stitching.</p>
<p>Slip the shears into the pocket of the case.
Then turn section B down over the shears to
find the best place to fold the flap. Mark the
fold with a pin.</p>
<p>Remove the shears and fold the flap on
the empty case. Measure the distance from
the fold to the cut edge in several places, to
be sure it is folded evenly. Then press the
fold lightly and pin into position.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08h.jpg" alt="{Case with pinned flap}" width="460" height="364" />
</div>
<p>Machine stitch &#8539; inch from the fold of
the flap, backstitching up to the stitching
line, and then moving forward.</p>
<p>Clip your threads closely, remove pins,
and you have completed your first project!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<h3>How to make your case colorful</h3>
<p>Now that you have learned to measure and
to use your sewing machine accurately, you
will find a great deal of enjoyment in combining
thread of a color contrasting with
your material. Stitching then becomes a decoration.
If you are really able to stitch
straight, stitch each pocket twice&mdash;each row
&#8539; inch apart, or the width of the presser foot
toe.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="Colored Thread" width="448" height="262" />
</div>
<p>You have a pattern and have learned how
simple it is to make this handy case. Why not
make a few more for gifts?</p>
<p>You could please your mother, or some of
your friends, if you made a case for their
shears, too.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c14">Barbecue placemats or traveling kit</h3>
<p>This project will give you more practice
in using the parts of the sewing machine you
have learned to use in making your shears
case. You may choose to make either placemats
or a traveling kit or both. The materials
and supplies used for each are the same, and
most of the stitching is the same. But the
number and size of pockets, as well as the
use of the article are different. Your bulletin
shows you how to make the pockets for each
article.</p>
<h3>Barbecue placemats</h3>
<p>When rolled and tied barbecue placemats
are easy carryalls for napkins and silverware
for a barbecue meal. When open, they are
placemats.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p09b.jpg" alt="{Barbecue placemats}" width="484" height="344" />
</div>
<h3>Traveling kit</h3>
<p>A traveling kit will hold some of the articles
you need in order to be well groomed
when you visit your friends&mdash;your toothbrush,
toothpaste, comb, hairbrush, hand lotion,
kleenex, etc. Or it can be used to hold
some of the supplies you need to keep your
clothes well groomed when you are traveling,
such as a clothes brush, shoe polish, and shoe
brush.</p>

<h4>What you will do first</h4>
<p>You will need to go shopping with your
mother to buy the towels, washcloths, shoestrings,
and thread.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p09d.jpg" alt="Will this color look nice with Mother&rsquo;s dishes?" width="568" height="256" />
</div>
<p>Two plain-colored, terry cloth finger
towels.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p09e.jpg" alt="Does one color MATCH your towel?" width="478" height="316" />
</div>
<p>One striped or checked washcloth (the design
will be your guide in stitching).</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p09f.jpg" alt="Does their color MATCH a color in The WASH CLOTH?" width="470" height="311" />
</div>
<p>One pair of plain colored shoestrings&mdash;27
inches long.</p>
<p>Two spools of thread; 1 to match stripes
and shoestrings and 1 to match the towels.</p>
<p>You will also need these tools from your
sewing box:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dd>Large shears</dd>
<dd>Pins and pincushion</dd>
<dd>Thimble</dd>
<dd>Paper bag</dd>
<dd>21-inch ruler</dd>
<dd>Needle</dd>
<dd>Scissors</dd></dl>
<p class="tb">Take another good peek at what your
placemat will look like when you are finished
(<a href="#Page_18">page 18</a>). In order to clearly show how you
will stitch the washcloth to the towel, a plain
washcloth is used in the illustrations instead
of a checked or striped one like you will be
using in your project.</p>
<h4>Start with the washcloth</h4>
<p><i>Fold</i> the washcloth <i>in half</i> with the
stripes running up and down. Then <i>pin the
open edges together</i> with 3 or 4 pins.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p09g.jpg" alt="FOLD and CUT" width="449" height="157" />
</div>
<p>Use shears to cut through the fold of the
washcloth to cut it in half. (Your leader will
show you how to handle the shears so that
you can take long, even cutting strokes.)</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p09h.jpg" alt="PIN, FOLD, CUT EDGE, PIN" width="462" height="190" />
</div>
<p>Fold each half washcloth again to find
the center. Mark the center with a pin at the
cut edge and on the hem edge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h4>Get the towels ready</h4>
<p>Find the center of the towels by folding
each in half&mdash;crosswise and right side out.
(If you do not recognize the right side of the
towel, ask your leader to help you.)</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="Are you working on the RIGHT SIDE of the towel?" width="539" height="442" />
</div>
<p>Mark the center of each towel with pins,
as you did the washcloth. But since the towel
is bigger than the washcloth, you will need
at least three pins on the fold to mark the
center line. Also insert a row of pins on the
right side of the towel, &frac12; inch from the lower
hem of the towel.</p>
<h4>Sew the washcloth and towel together</h4>
<p>Find the place for the washcloth on the
towel by matching the center of the washcloth
with the center of the towel. Then
bring the cut edge of the washcloth up to the
row of pins.</p>
<p class="tb">Pin the washcloth in place as shown in
the illustration. Sew a hand-basting stitch
along the hem of the towel to hold the washcloth
in place when stitching it with the sewing
machine. Since many of you have never
sewn by hand, your leader will give you a
special demonstration on how to thread the
needle and baste. Try to keep the stitches
about &frac14; inch in length.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p10c.jpg" alt="Are the MARGINS even?" width="440" height="453" />
</div>
<p>Stitch the washcloth to the towel from the
wrong side of the towel. You will be making
a &frac14; inch seam, or you might stitch just to the
inside of the hem. Your leader will show you
where your stitching line looks best.</p>
<p>Adjust the stitch regulator to sew backward.
If your sewing machine cannot be adjusted
to go in reverse, raise your presser
foot slightly above the fabric at the edge of
the washcloth and take 4 or 5 stitches. The
fabric will not move but the thread will become
knotted and fastened.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p10g.jpg" alt="Backstitch to edge of Washcloth; 12 STITCHES per inch" width="423" height="302" />
</div>
<p>Lower the needle into the towel at a point
&frac14; inch from the side hem of the washcloth.
Keep both threads to the back of the presser
foot. Then lower the presser foot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Start to use the machine by turning the
fly wheel by hand until the needle reaches
the edge of the washcloth. Adjust the stitch
regulator so the machine will sew forward
again&mdash;12 stitches per inch. Stitch (using
electricity) until you reach the other side of
the washcloth.</p>
<p class="tb">Readjust the regulator for backstitching,
and hand turn the flywheel as you did on the
other side of the seam, or if you do not have
this regulator, again raise the presser foot
very slightly and turn the flywheel 4 or 5
stitches to knot the thread.</p>
<h4>Sew pockets into the washcloth</h4>
<p>Fold the washcloth up onto the towel,
hiding the seam which you just finished. Pin
the washcloth in place, as shown in the illustration.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p10h.jpg" alt="ARE YOUR MARGINS EVEN?" width="484" height="302" />
</div>
<p>Stitch the side edges into place. If the
hem on the washcloth is heavy, ask your
leader to show you how to stitch just inside
the hem to avoid bulk. If the hem is not
heavy, stitch close to the edge by having the
edge of the washcloth follow along the inside
edge of the presser foot.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p10k.jpg" alt="Backstitch" width="388" height="206" />
</div>
<p>Pockets for the placemat or traveling kit
are made by stitching the washcloth to the
towel as shown in the illustration below.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p10m.jpg" alt="Towel; Pockets in Washcloth" width="456" height="274" />
</div>
<p>To make the placemat, place a napkin,
knife, fork, and spoon on the washcloth to
give you an idea about the size of the pockets
needed.</p>
<p>To make the traveling kit, choose the articles
you would like to take and place them
on the placemat.</p>
<p>Choose the stripes or checks nearest to
the size pocket needed for each article; they
will be your guide for stitching. Pin the
washcloth to the towel along these stripes to
make the pockets which you will stitch later.
Slip the articles you want them to hold into
the pockets to be sure you have left enough
room for them. If everything slips into position
easily, you are ready to sew. If not, the
pockets can be made bigger by moving the
pins to another stripe.</p>
<p>When you have decided which stripe you
will use for each pocket, begin by backstitching
at the lower seam and stitch up to
the top of the washcloth. Backstitch again.
One&mdash;two&mdash;three rows of stitching&mdash;and your
pockets are finished!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<h4>Attach the tie to the towel</h4>
<p>If the shoestring is very different in color
from the towel, change the spool of thread to
the color which matches the shoestring. Fold
the shoestring in half. Pin the midpoint of
the string to the towel at the point marked in
the picture.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p11.jpg" alt="{Wrong Side of towel}" width="447" height="269" />
</div>
<p>Fasten the string with very small stitches,
by sewing back and forth across the width.
Then clip threads close to the stitching line.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p11b.jpg" alt="Towel" width="416" height="228" />
</div>
<h4>Finish your project</h4>
<p>If you made a placemat insert a napkin,
knife, fork, and spoon into the pockets. Or if
you made a traveling kit, put your toilet articles
or brushes in the pockets. Fold the upper
edge down to cover the items. Then roll up
the towel from the right to the left. Wrap
the shoestring around it and tie it into a
pretty bow. Your simple towel, washcloth,
and shoestring have changed into <i>barbecue
placemats</i> ... or a useful <i>traveling kit</i>!</p>
